# Spacebucket_Arduino_Nano_ESP32
A Spacebucket Controlled via Arduino Nano ESP32 
This project aims to implement a Arduino Nano ESP32 as the primary controller of the Growenvironment in a Spacebucket. The idea is to use the spacebucket as a selfcontained growing device with minimal with
minimal interference from the Grower (i.e. opening the device to check on the plant and maintain it). The goal ist to implement several sensors (lightintensity, temperature, humidity of soil and air) a
display for convinience and maybe an automation water irigation system and fan controll.
Since I'm a noob in coding, this is a learning project, help is welcome.

Components:;
Board: Arduino Nano ESP32; 
Display: Waveshare 2.23 Inch OLED HAT (SSD1305);
Soil sensor: BerryBase Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2.0.0;
